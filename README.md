# Python practice - Vigenère cipher

Here is the [Wikipedia-Link Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)

This is a practice project for learning Python and git/ github.

*The goal:*
The goal is to write a program to encyrpt and decrypt messages with the Vigenère cipher. There are certain points to keep in mind:
- Since only alphabetical characters can be encrypted, the cleartext should be cleaned up fron any non-alphabetical characters. Also, convert all the characters into uppcercase characters. 
- Since the keyword/ keyphrase to use during the encryption should be individual, the program should ask for the keyword/ keyphrase
